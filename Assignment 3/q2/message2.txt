What the world really needs most of all is not spite. We've got enough spite in the world. But another simple happy chorus song. Well, why not? Something in which all can join, for a change, something which expresses the feelings of all the ordinary people, all over the world...

I think we've found such a song. It's called...
It's called... "WHEEE!-POP!-OOOHHH!"

This is a chorus song, please join in!

Very interesting, actually, we originally thought of calling this song "WHEEE!-POP!-BLBLBLBLB!" but we thought this sounded rather stupid.

A song, we feel, very much for our time:

Swann: Oh, when you're feeling kind of blue,
Flanders: Kind of blu...
Swann: And you don't know what to do,
Flanders: What to d...
Swann: And you've got a load of troubles on your mind,
Flanders: On your m...
Swann: If you face them with a smile,
It will make your life worthwhile,
Flanders: (Grumbles)
Swann: And you'll find that every cloud is silver-lined.
Both: Sing this happy song with me,
WHEEE!-POP!-OOOHHH!
Such a simple melody,
WHEEE!-POP!-OOOHHH!
Once those skies above are grey,
You can face the world today,
If you'll only learn to say,
WHEEE!-POP!-OOOHHH!

Flanders: All together!

Swann: When your life is filled with care,
Flanders: WHEEE!-POP!-OOOHHH!
Both: You will hear it everywhere,
Flanders: WHEEE!-POP!-OOOHHH!
Both: Though the world may wear a frown,
Here's a way to win renown,
Tell them as they strap you down,
"WHEEE!-POP!" and "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHH!"

Thanks to all staff and students :).$
